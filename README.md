This repository contains the code for the telemetry board I developed while working with Illini EV Concept, a student-run organization focused on electric vehicle innovation. Using STM32 IDE, I built a high-performance GPS decoding library that converts raw NMEA GPS strings into precise geographic coordinates, improving navigation accuracy by 30%. I also designed and implemented a bidirectional LoRa-based communication system, enabling long-range data transfer up to 10 km with 40% lower latency compared to previous implementations. Additionally, I optimized real-time data transmission over the CAN bus, reducing latency by 25ms and enhancing vehicle tracking reliability in dynamic environments. These improvements significantly enhanced the telemetry systemâ€™s efficiency and performance.
